## Project Plan

1. **Study and Analysis**
   - Task: Define the project scope, types of mathematical expressions to be recognized, and the complexity level of these expressions.
   - Research: Familiarize with existing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) methods and technologies, especially those used for recognizing mathematical symbols and expressions.

2. **Preprocessing of Images**
   - Normalization: Rescale images to a standard size and scale.
   - Binarization: Convert images to black and white for simplified analysis.
   - Noise Filtering: Remove noise from images using filters (e.g., Gaussian).

3. **Text Detection and Segmentation**
   - Edge Detection: Apply edge detection algorithms, such as the Canny algorithm.
   - Character Segmentation: Split images into individual characters using clustering methods or connected component analysis.

4. **Character Classification**
   - Vectorization: Transform segmented characters into feature vectors using techniques like Fourier transform.
   - Classification: Utilize machine learning algorithms for character classification.

5. **Expression Interpretation**
   - Parsing: Assemble characters into mathematical expressions, considering their relationships and positions.
   - Validation: Check syntax and logical correctness of assembled expressions.

6. **Testing and Optimization**
   - Evaluation: Test the algorithm on various images and address any errors.
   - Optimization: Tune algorithm parameters to improve accuracy and speed.
